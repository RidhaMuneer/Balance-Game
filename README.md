# Balance-Game

## This is a balance game that is based on the readings that the processing application gets from the ultrasonic sensor that is connected directly to the Arduino Uno.

## It would start by having the player on a steep object so that it would be challenging to keep balancing on it for a long.

## This game uses the reading from the aforementioned sensor to calculate the distance between the player and the sensor, and if that player is in the right range of distance, it will start a stopwatch that will be paused if the player is not picked on by the sensor. And the player would have three tries before that player fails and the stopwatch stops and his score would be printed on the screen.
